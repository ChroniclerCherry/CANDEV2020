This can be measured based on the number of electric vehicle and alternative fuel stations on key coast-to-coast transportation corridors, by fuel type.

The intermediate demand-side outcome would be that targeted end-users take action to use lower carbon transportation options. This can be measured based on share of electric and alternative fuel vehicle sales.

The intermediate supply-side outcome is that targeted audiences take action to make lower carbon transportation options available to end-users. The indicator will be the number of recharging and refueling stations that are planned, under development and completed by funded project proponents (potential owners/operators of recharging/refueling stations), along key coast-to-coast transportation corridors, by fuel type. A second indicator, the ratio of funding leveraged from potential owners/operators of recharging/refueling stations, will also be tracked.

The GCWood Program launch follows the Government?s Budget 2017 announcement of $39.8M over four years, starting in April 2018, to undertake this initiative.

The GCWood Program supports Canada?s transition to a more wood-inclusive construction industry by funding projects that encourage:

Greater adoption and commercialization of wood-based products in the construction of innovative tall wood buildings, timber bridges, and low-rise non-residential wood buildings;
Replication of demonstrated innovative non-traditional wood-based buildings and timber bridges; and,
Research that addresses the gap in technical information needed to facilitate revisions to the 2020 and 2025 National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) to allow tall wood buildings beyond the current 6 storey limit.
The Program provides non-repayable contributions of up to 100% of a project?s eligible incremental costs for the demonstration of innovative engineered wood products and systems. The funding is intended to offset the cost of being the ?first mover? of wood-intensive projects, and to support the development of knowledge and tools to support the success of future projects.

","The GCWood Program will directly contribute to the following results:

Regulatory agencies and specifiers (engineers, designers and architects) have the information they need to determine product, performance and environmental credentials;
Architects, engineers, and builders have the information and tools necessary to pursue wood-based building projects;
Regulatory acceptance/recognition of Canadian wood products and building systems in building codes, standards, and policies.
